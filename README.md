# NFTWAP
simulate twap functionality with pooled floor nfts 

General idea would be to allow users who want to sell their nfts at roughly the same time to
pool them together under a single smart contract and sell them at floor price under pre-defined
time intervals

Given many users only have a single NFT (or limited supply), this would provide an alternative
to fractionalized selling (which often has limited demand)

Will make eventually
